    <p><b>Here's a timeline of Virat Kohli's life:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>1988 - </b>Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family.</li>
        <li><b>1998 - </b>The West Delhi Cricket Academy was created and a nine-year-old Kohli was part of it.</li>
        <li><b>2002 - </b>Kohli first played for Delhi Under-15 team in October 2002 in the 2002–03 Polly Umrigar Trophy. He was the leading run-scorer for his team in that tournament with 172 runs at an average of 34.40.</li>
        <li><b>2006 - </b>In July 2006, Kohli was selected in the India Under-19 squad on its tour of England. He averaged 105 in the three-match ODI series against England Under-19s and 49 in the three-match Test series.</li>
        <li><b>2008 - </b>In February–March 2008, Kohli captained the victorious Indian team at the 2008 ICC Under-19 Cricket World Cup held in Malaysia.

        <li><b>2011 - </b>Kohli played in every match of India's successful World Cup campaign. In the final against Sri Lanka at Mumbai, he scored 35, sharing an 83-run partnership with Gambhir for the third wicket after India had lost both openers within the seventh over chasing 275.
